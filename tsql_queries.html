	  <h2>SQL queries</h2>
	  <p>During my first year in the program IT Database Administration, I had two SQL courses: Data Fundamentals and Transactional Database Programming, the former in the first semester and the latter in the second one. In the first course, I learned the basic concepts of relational database, how to read an ERD and some basic manipulation commands. In the second one, I had more exposure to big datasets and developed my skills with data manipulation, data formatting and data moving. I also created views, subqueries and stored procedures. </p>
	  <p>In this worksample, I can show my improvement in this subject, comparing two queries: one from the first course and the other from the second.</p>

	  <p>The first sample is a query to join three tables - Department, Employee and Reservation. The result is the total mileage of the cars rented by all employees of each department per month. To create this query, I used my knowledge about relationships to join the tables and get the expected result. I also used aggregation to sum all the values for the same department in the same month.</p>

	  <p>After doing the second course, I could do some improvements in this first query, like using aliases or subqueries to simplify the code.</p>
	  
	  <p>The second query is more complex. I first created a view joining the tables that I wanted to use and selected the most important fields. Then I created a stored procedure that can take one or two parameters as input and return different datasets accordingly.</p>

	  <p>In the second sample, I can demonstrate my ability to select data from multiple tables and format it to nice report, easy to read.</p>
